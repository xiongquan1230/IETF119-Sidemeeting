More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for establishing networking connections anywhere and anytime, alongside 
the availability of highly distributive any-cloud services. Such a demand motivates the need to efficiently interconnect heterogeneous 
entities, e.g., different domains of network and cloud owned by different providers, with the goal of reducing cost, e.g., overheads 
and end-to-end latency, while ensuring the overall performance satisfies the requirements of the applications. Considering that 
different network domains and cloud providers may adopt different types of technologies, the key of interconnection and efficient 
coordination is to employ a unified interface that can be understood by heterogeneous parties which could derive the consistent 
requirements of the same service and treat the service traffic appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies. 
This side meeting is initiated to have broad discussions about use cases, problem statements and requirements for a standalone Service ID.

The primary agenda is shown as below.

1. 18:30-18:35 Note well, welcome statements, introduction and agenda bash. Daniel Huang. 5mins

2. 18:35-18:55 Thinking on scenarios where IP networks empower applications. Presenter: Feng Yang (China Mobile). 20mins

3. 18:55-19:15 IP network 3.0: solution of fine-granularity deterministic networking capability as a service. Presenter:  Cancan Huang (China Telecom). 20mins.

4. 19:15-19:35 Standalone service ID in routing network. Presenter: Dongyu Yuan (ZTE). 20mins

5. 19:35-20:00 Open discussions. Daniel Huang. 25mins

*How will the pattern of IP networks and service infrastructure evolve and develop?

*Scenarios and corresponding values for IP networks empowering applications and services?

*Principles and methods for collaborative design of unified interfaces between IP networks and services?
